# Simple Business Management System
 
This system is from a server I used to run the development team on in 2020, the code has been slightly modified since then to bring it up to a more modern standing, but still needs some work to be "good"
 </br>
This requires database changes, and I do not have the SQL File on hand to grab the table required. If you were planning on using this, id recommend using something like Renewed Scripts Business Script.

This is more of a portolio release than a useful thing to release to the fivem community.
